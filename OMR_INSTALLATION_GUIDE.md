## üìÅ Files Created

### 1. **Core OMR Scanner** (`/workspace/omr_scanner.html`)
Standalone HTML file with complete OMR processing capabilities

### 2. **PHP Backend Integration** 
- **Controller**: `/workspace/application/controllers/omr_scanner.php`
- **View**: `/workspace/application/views/default/omr_scanner.php`
- **JavaScript**: `/workspace/assets/js/omr-processor.js`

### 3. **Database Setup** (`/workspace/omr_database_setup.sql`)
Complete database schema with all necessary tables

## üõ† Installation Steps

### Step 1: Database Setup
```sql
-- Execute the SQL script in your MySQL database
mysql -u your_username -p your_database < omr_database_setup.sql
```

### Step 2: PHP Integration
The OMR system is already integrated into your existing CodeIgniter structure:
- Controller is placed in `application/controllers/`
- View is placed in `application/views/default/`
- JavaScript processor is in `assets/js/`

### Step 3: Access the System
Navigate to: `http://your-domain/omr_scanner`

### Step 4: Configure Answer Keys
1. Go to the OMR Scanner page
2. Click "Manage Answer Keys"
3. Create answer keys for your exams

## üéØ How It Works

### Image Processing Pipeline
1. **Image Upload**: Supports JPEG/PNG files up to 10MB
2. **Perspective Correction**: Automatically detects and corrects sheet orientation
3. **Preprocessing**: Noise reduction, contrast enhancement, morphological operations
4. **OCR Processing**: Extracts student name and other text information
5. **Bubble Detection**: Dynamically locates and analyzes answer bubbles
6. **Scoring**: Compares detected answers with answer key
7. **Results Storage**: Saves to database with detailed analytics

### Adaptive Features
- **Dynamic Coordinate Mapping**: No hardcoded bubble positions
- **Multiple Sheet Formats**: Supports different OMR layouts (currently optimized for 60-question format)
- **Quality Validation**: Confidence scoring for each detection
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation for poor quality images

## üîß Configuration Options

### Image Processing Settings
```javascript
// In omr-processor.js, you can adjust:
this.confidenceThreshold = 0.3;        // Minimum confidence for OCR
this.minBubbleFillRatio = 0.25;        // Minimum fill to consider bubble marked
this.maxBubbleFillRatio = 0.9;         // Maximum fill (avoid over-filled bubbles)
```

### Template Configuration
The system supports different OMR templates through the `omr_templates` table:
- Question count (default: 60)
- Column layout (default: 2 columns, 30 questions each)
- Bubble positioning parameters

## üìä Database Schema

### Key Tables Created:
- **`omr_results`**: Stores scan results and scores
- **`omr_answer_keys`**: Manages correct answers for exams
- **`omr_answer_details`**: Detailed question-by-question analysis
- **`omr_templates`**: Different OMR sheet layouts
- **`omr_scan_sessions`**: Batch processing tracking

## üé® User Interface Features

### Modern Dashboard
- **Drag & Drop Upload**: Easy image uploading
- **Real-time Progress**: Visual feedback during processing
- **Confidence Indicators**: Color-coded reliability metrics
- **Interactive Results**: Detailed answer-by-answer breakdown
- **Export Capabilities**: Multiple format support

### Administrative Features
- **Answer Key Management**: Easy creation/editing of answer keys
- **Batch Processing**: Handle multiple sheets simultaneously
- **Reporting Dashboard**: Comprehensive analytics
- **Error Tracking**: Detailed logs and debugging information

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Could not detect" name**
   - Ensure name area is clear and legible
   - Check image quality and lighting
   - Verify OCR language settings

2. **Poor bubble detection**
   - Adjust confidence thresholds in JavaScript
   - Ensure bubbles are properly filled (dark, complete)
   - Check image resolution (minimum 1000px width recommended)

3. **Perspective correction issues**
   - Ensure full OMR sheet is visible in image
   - Avoid excessive shadows or glare
   - Keep image reasonably straight

### Debug Mode
Enable debug mode by setting `debugMode = true` in the OMRProcessor class to see detailed processing logs.

## üîÑ Comparison: Before vs After

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Test the system** with your actual OMR sheets
2. **Adjust parameters** based on your specific sheet format
3. **Create answer keys** for your exams
4. **Train users** on proper image capture techniques
5. **Monitor performance** and fine-tune as needed

## üìû Support

The system includes comprehensive logging and debugging features. Check the debug panel in the interface for detailed processing information.

### For optimal results:
- Use well-lit, clear images
- Ensure OMR sheets are reasonably flat
- Fill bubbles completely and darkly
- Avoid stray marks near bubbles
